what does my website do?

https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

search a summoner, render data.
data rendered should go as far back as possible. (idk how far back match history goes.)
match data should be stored on a backend. (might cost money AWS or Azure)
you should then be able to query (filter) by any parameters you set
E.G. I want to bring up all my games veigar against kassadin. what success do i have with electro? with comet?

What types of queries do i want? (filter by...)
- query by your champion 
	- this might be a prerequisite for other filters.
- query by champion on enemy team
	- might have to code lane prediction , but idk
	- can also manually enter what lane you played (POST request)
- query by champion on your team
- query by rune you took
	- major rune or minor rune? (minor rune might be annoying idk)
- query by item you built
	- robustness- what if you sold all items end of game and bought 6 tears
- query by dragons
	- we got -'soul' OR <choice of soul>
	- they got - 'soul' OR <choice of soul>
	- show winrate
- query by rift herald
	- same as dragons
- query by time
	- game ended 20 - 25 minutes
	- game ended > 30 minutes
	- game ended < 16 minutes 20 seconds
- query by patch - be able to specify from what patch to what patch. (whats your winrate with patch)
	- patch 12.0 - 12.0
	- patch 12.1 - now
- query by elo
	- eliminate smurf queue outliers and take the average elo
- by summoner name on team/enemy team (make 2 different settings probably)
	- should conjure a winrate with, winrate against.
	- should show what champions they picked and winrate
	- robustness - what if a summoner changes his name? 
- should be able to manually delete a game from the CURRENT search (so it doesnt affect the stats)
	- maybe if you click something, it grays out and the stats get updated.
	- making a post request to actually delete something from a search requires more infrastructure, i dont wanna do it

- ANOTHER function of my website - block list/ summoner notes. any wintraders in queue? (might be a separate app)
	- need a login functionality (or maybe more simply, a password system)
	- should show previous notes you wrote about
	- should accept op.gg style XXX joined the lobby XXX joined the lobby
	- option to delete a note/add a note
- leveled up skills in a certain way?






What data is available in the API? how many of your queries are even possible? impossible?
lets list out apis, what they do, what key values they have
ACCOUNT-V1
gets ingamename and server using puuid.
(using this, can we track previous names past namechanges?)
puuid doesnt change even if you change in game name


SUMMONER-v4 uses name, gets:
accountid
puuid -----globally unique------others are not----------------can use this to get gamename and server using Account-V1
summonerid(id)
all are encrypted. 


data dragon (ddragon) has images and info about champs, runes, items
- translates championIDs to names.
