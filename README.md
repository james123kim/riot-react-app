The goal of this project is to make something useful while learning React and the Riot API.
This app will allow you to pull up games based on queries. 
How do I get all of my games against Kassadin?
How do I get all of my games as Veigar vs Kassadin?
How do I get all of my games as Veigar vs Kassadin, but only ones where I took predator?

By providing queries for your games, you can pull up and study only the games that you want to see.
This should provide selective data that is useful to you. 
What is my winrate vs kassadin as veigar? as velkoz? with comet? with electrocute? 
How often do I get first dragon in that situation? first rift? first soul?
What is my winrate with first dragon?
